# Milston

Milston is a library for creating task managers. The idea behind it, is to provide an interface to build different clients (CLI, Web, GUI...) around it. This allows changing between different clients keeping the data and the config without the need to export and import it.

## Why this library?

First of all, it aims to provide a single easy to use interface to make Project management apps. Secondly, it's an easy and simple library to learn best practices regarding Rust development. I will gladly apply Pull Requests no only related to functionality but also to code refactoring regarding idiomatic changes or design patterns.

The implementation should provide enough methods to be able to change almost anything while keeping an stable API at least for now.
